# AI Test Benchmark

To quickly test generated tests, run the following command:
```
bash run_all_tests.sh
```

This will generate a coverage report for all tests for all languages.

## Projects

Projects can be added under the "benchmarks" folder under their respective language. Project templates must be created in order to ensure the functionality for generating test reports works.

## Docker Setup

Docker can optionally be set-up depending on your needs, but a local machine should be sufficient enough. A Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml is provided
